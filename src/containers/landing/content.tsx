      Boston's trees do a lot for our community - they clean our polluted air,
      offer shade on scorching summer days, 'block wind on freezing winter
      nights, and prevent flooding during storms. At Speak for the Trees, '
      we're determined to improve the size, health, and equity of our urban
      forest, especially in under-served and under-canopied communities. And now
      you can help grow Boston's urban forest by adopting and caring for a tree!
